            <p><strong>Javascript, HTML and CSS</strong><br><br>
                Imagine a human body. HTML is like the basic structure all bodies share, the bones, the muscles, the skin. CSS is how you present yourself, the clothes you wear, piercings or tattoos. Javascript is like the brain controlling your body’s behaviour, it can make your body move, make your heart beat, and allow you to make other decisions as you navigate through the world in your body.

            <p><strong>Control flow and loops</strong><br><br>
                Control flow refers to the order or ‘flow’ of code to be executed in javascript, usually this is from top to bottom. However, certain parts of the code can change this course by using statements like functions (do this task now, and maybe later too) conditionals (do this thing if this other thing is true) and loops (do something until it’s done). 

                A loop is like going to work. You have a certain amount of work to complete in a day before you can go home, this is like a ‘condition’ inside a loop. If you’re bored of working, but you aren’t finished, you would continue through the ‘loop’ of working because you haven’t met the condition. You keep going through the ‘loop’ of working until you have finished your tasks for the day (the ‘condition’) and then you can go home, yay!

            <p><strong>The DOM</strong><br><br>
                The DOM is a programming interface, this means it allows programmes and programmers a way to interact with the HTML and CSS by breaking it into component parts. A very simple analogy would be translating a text into a different language (being the DOM) so someone else (like Little Miss Javascript) can read and even edit that text.  This allows Little Miss Javascript to interact with and manipulate HTML and CSS!

          <div class="main-paragraph">
            <p>
              Little Miss Javascript is all about interactivity, she’s a go getter and she wants to make things happen! She uses the DOM to change things, remove things and generally make things fun and funky on our page.
                
                The component parts of the DOM are organised like a tree, meaning that their are ‘parents’ who have ‘children’, and those ‘children’ may also have ‘children’ and so on. So when Little Miss Javascript wants to make something happen, she can call on that particular child she wants all the way through their lineage. She can also call on the whole tree and get back elements by their name, id, class or tag! She is a girlboss.

          </div>
          <div class="main-paragraph">
            <p>In this example if Little Miss Javascript wanted to access all the 'h1' or heading elements, she could say this:<br><br>

              <span style="color:magenta;">querySelector(‘h1’)</span>
              <br><br>
              But that will only bring back the first h1 element. If there were multiple h1 elements and she wanted to see all of them, she could say this:
              <br><br>
              <span style="color:magenta;">querySelectorAll(‘h1’)</span>
              </p>
          </div>
          <div class="main-paragraph">
            <p><strong>Arrays and Objects</strong><br><br>
                Objects and arrays are both ways to store data inside of a variable. 

                Objects can store data inside a variable by using pairs called key/value pairs. These are like two things that go together, and there can be any number of these pairs. We can access this information through dot notation by using the variable.key or variable[key] method:
                <br><br>
                <p style="text-align:left;color:magenta">let person = {<br>
                  firstName: ‘Little Miss’,<br>
                  lastName: ‘Javascript’,<br>
                  age: ‘ageless’<br>
                  };</p><br>
                
                  <span style="color:magenta;">person.firstName</span> would return ‘Little Miss’ and <span style="color:magenta;">person[‘age’]</span> would return ‘ageless’.<br><br>
                
                An array is like a numbered list, so we can store multiple values inside a single variable. We can also access this list by their position on said list ie first, third, eighth etc, or by using a loop to ‘read’ through the whole list . Remember the first position on the array is zero! <br><br>
                
                <p style="text-align:left;color:magenta;">let littleMissJs = [‘cool’, ‘fun’, ‘funky’];</p>

                <span style="color:magenta;">littleMissJs[0]</span> would return ‘cool’ and <span style="color:magenta;">littleMissJs[2]</span> would return 'funky'.
                
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="main-paragraph">
            <p><strong>Functions</strong><br><br>
                Functions are pieces of code we can use to perform a specific task. To make functions happen, Little Miss Javascript has to ‘call’ them and make sure they do their job. Functions can be called at any point in the code, and as many times as you like, so they're very useful when Little Miss Javascript needs to do a repetitive task, and it helps code readability.
