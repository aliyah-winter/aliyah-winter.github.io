            <p><strong>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong>
            <br><br>My long term goal is to hopefully get a junior role in tech, and keep learning more. 
            I also like the idea of doing freelance work on the side in keeping with my art practice. 
            I don’t have a specific area I want to move into but am open to seeing what takes my interest.

            <p><strong>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</strong>
            <br><br>I’m pretty dedicated when it comes to learning, I like to delve into things and really explore them, the downside being that sometimes I can get too stuck on things. 
            I’m open to new ways of learning things, and try to keep my mind flexible in that way. 

            I also know that sometimes stepping away from things and coming back to them gives you a fresh perspective and allows you to better find a solution to any challenges that come up. 
            I also like working on multiple tasks at once, I like the challenge, although sometimes this can make me a bit scatterbrained.
            
            I can struggle to ask for help, and be stubborn in preferring to try and figure things out myself. 
            I am learning that reaching out to others and can help fast and then gain new knowledge and strengthen relationships in the process.

            <p><strong>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong>
            <br><br>I’m interested to see how my relationship to teamwork and collaboration may change in my time at Dev Academy, especially because of the intensive nature of the course and working often with people I haven’t met.

            <p><strong>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </strong>
            <br><br>I’m going to make sure I manage my time well, and be clear in communication with others about my abilities and expectations. 
            I will also be open to meeting new people and working with others on projects. 
            I will also be respectful of other people at all times, and responsive to their boundaries and needs as well as my own.

            I will make sure I take regular breaks away when I need to, but if things do get too much I will communicate this with others, and ask for help when I need. 
            Next step would be to reach out to my facilitators and let them know.

          <div class="main-paragraph">
            <p><strong>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</strong>
            <br><br>As soon as I know that I need help I will reach out to whoever I need to, most immediately my group members or cohort either via message or in person. 
            Then escalate to facilitators. 
            I think timely communication is key, as I don’t want to fall behind.

            <p><strong>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</strong>
              <br><br>I expect responsiveness and support when I or others do reach out for help or issues, and the continued general guidance from them.

          <div class="main-paragraph">
            <p><strong>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</strong>
              <br><br>I do have hour long weekly appointments that I have to commit to, currently on Thursday mornings. 
              But I will shift these to my lunchtimes, or a different time during bootcamp so that it interferes the least with my studies.
