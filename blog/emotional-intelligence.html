            <p><strong>What is Emotional Intelligence?</strong><br><br>
                Broadly emotional intelligence (or EQ) can be defined as the ability to perceive, control and evaluate emotions, your own as well as those of others.

                Awareness of strengths and limitations, knowing when to ask for help and knowing when you will excel. Also related to this is increased self-confidence through self-awareness and self-acceptance.
                <br><br>
                Emotional regulation is to notice what you are feeling without completely identifying with it or letting it overwhelm you. It is related to mindfulness in the way that you are noticing what is happening in your body, the sensations, as well as noticing your emotions, but not acting on them. This allows you to notice how you are feeling, and make decisions about how you want to act rather than simply reacting to what you are immediately feeling. This is related to better emotional regulation, the ability to not be overwhelmed or ‘driven’ by your emotions. Because of this EQ also involves a greater capacity to accept change and accept responsibility for mistakes. Because we are able to connect with our emotions and motivations, we are more likely to be able to push through to overcome any obstacle, and so mistakes (and accepting responsibility for them) are seen as part of the process rather than focusing on negative feelings associated with them.
                <br><br>
                Empathy and sensitivity towards others, to be able to notice and understand the emotions of other people, through both verbal and non-verbal cues. This may involve hearing what someone is saying about how they are feeling, or ‘reading between the lines’ as it were to see how their behaviour is influenced by how they are feeling. Non-verbal cues involve reading body language, paying attention to facial reactions and being able to ‘read’ another person’s body to know how they are feeling, even if they are saying something different. This allows you to be able to know where someone is coming from, and understand through being able to put yourself in their shoes, and relate to how they are feeling and why they are making the decisions they make.

            <p><strong>How is it different to IQ?</strong><br><br>IQ is about measuring intelligence, problem solving, use of logic and understanding complex concepts. It is used as a static measure of intelligence, and is perceived to be related to your innate ‘smartness’. EQ is related to your recognise emotion in yourself and others which influences your behaviours and decisions, and is something is malleable, can be worked on and can change over a lifetime.</p>

            <p><strong>Why is it important?</strong><br><br>
                EQ helps us navigate the world and relationships with others, when we better understand how we and others are feeling, we have a deep understanding of our and others motivations and how this influences our decisions and how we move through the world more generally. This understanding increases self-acceptance and happiness in a sense, helps have better relationships (in the workplace and our personal lives) and helps us to better resolve conflict, and generally achieve our goals. It seems to me to be really about essential life skills, which can help us to navigate life through all its ups and downs.
