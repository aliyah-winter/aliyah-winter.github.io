            <p><strong>How neuroplasiticty can benefit people</strong><br><br>
                When people understand neuroplasticity and how it works, they are able to realise how much they can change, adapt and grow due to the malleability of the brain, and the formation of new neural pathways through repeated use. This means that we can change our habits, behaviours, and ways of thinking, and even our capacity to learn new things. This forging and weakening of neural pathways occurs across our lifetimes.

            <p><strong>How neuroplasiticty can benefit me</strong><br><br>
                While I am learning how to code and program, I am creating completely new neural pathways in my brain. I’m already realising just how much I am able to learn when I persist in learning these new skills, because my brain is in the process of creating new pathways.

            <p><strong>Ways to increase neuroplasticity</strong><br><br>
                Learning a new skill, learning a language, engaging in artistic pursuits, listening to music, exercising, dancing, doing meditation and yoga all help with increasing neuroplasticity in the brain.

            <p><strong>What is a growth mindset and why is it relevant?</strong><br><br>
                A fixed mindset is part of the idea that intelligence, ability and personality is fixed and static and cannot be changed. Whereas a growth mindset is based around the idea that intelligence, ability, and personality are dynamic, and can be changed through deliberate practice, and this changes the relationship to challenges, and seeing failure not as a reflection of self but as an opportunity to learn.

         <div class="main-paragraph">
            <p><strong>In this exploration, did anything surprise me or change for me?</strong><br><br>
                When I was reading about how a growth mindset creates a hunger for learning rather than a need to prove oneself, I could relate to that from my own experiences with learning, and then realised that I could change my yearning to prove myself by being curious about learning itself, seeing ‘failings’ as opportunities to learn. I also realise that I have both fixed and growth mindsets in different areas of my life, which was really eye opening.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div class="main-paragraph">
            <p><strong>How will I integrate growth mindset into my learning journey?</strong><br><br>
                I hope that I am able to see myself on my learning journey encountering many setbacks, overwhelms and challenges as opportunities to learn, especially to stick with things even when they are not going well, and to reach out to others for help in order to learn. I think this will help me greatly in my learning journey.

         <div class="main-paragraph">
            <p><strong>How will these understandings may shape or influence my learning plan and strategy?</strong><br><br>
                Working towards having a growth mindset will really help my ability to learn at while doing this course, especially in the way I deal with encountering challenges or setbacks, reaching out for help and seeing failures as an opportunity to learn. Remembering that I can change my actual neural pathways through deliberate practice lets me know that I can cultivate a growth mindset and learn all this new information through practice. I think also recognising the importance of rest for the brain when learning new information is really important too, I have noticed this as I have been studying and want to make an effort to have good sleep hygiene and practice mindfulness.
