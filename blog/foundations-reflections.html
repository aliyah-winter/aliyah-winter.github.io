                <strong>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</strong><br><br>
                I have learned that my inner critic is very loud when I am learning. Like feeling imposter syndrome and that little voice in my head telling me ‘you can’t do it’ when I feel frustrated. But keeping in mind the ‘not yet’ of growth mindset has really helped with me being able to overcome what I feel is a really steep learning curve as someone who has never coded before, to being able to get through the sprints.

                <strong>What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</strong><br><br>
                Self-awareness is knowing your strengths and weaknesses, and being able to notice your emotions as you move through the learning process. Empathy is an important starting point in being able to work with others, and being able to see their own process as they are learning as well. This allows you to see where they are coming from, and how you might be able to help. Values are also part of self-awareness, and knowing what you value helps you to know how you are learning, and be able to see how others values also inform their learning journey.

                <strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong><br><br>
                How integral emotional intelligence is to learning anything. Going through this course and noticing how many difficult emotions come up, it really makes sense that emotional intelligence is vital to being able to get over those intense moments of frustration and self-doubt.

                <strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</strong><br><br>
                Definitely all the internal reflection, especially related to my own self-doubt and places of fixed mindset. Its really uncomfortable to have to face into those things that are limiting you, and even more uncomfortable to let them go or try to change them. But I know that learning to sit with the discomfort and feel it its productive to being able to change.

                <strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</strong><br><br>
                It makes sense for the intensity and amount of learning that takes place in bootcamp, that you need to be prepared for how it’s going to feel to move quite fast and take in a lot of information at once. It’s inevitable that there will be moments of overwhelm, and maybe wanting to give up, so it feels important to have knowledge and skills about how to deal with that when it comes up.

                <strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong><br><br>
                No, it’s not a waste of time. I’m learning about concepts and skills that will help me to be able to get through the bootcamp, and to be able to work with others on projects. I can also learn a lot by being able to work with others, but won’t be able to work with others if I don’t have those core skills either. And it’s preparing me to go out into the workforce with a mindset that will allow me easily to fit into a team, and deal with ongoing challenges.that will inevitably come up. One thing that keeps being repeated is that employers are looking for people who will fit well into a team and enhance their workplace, and that having programming skills is not on it’s own the most useful thing.
