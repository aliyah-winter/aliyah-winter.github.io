              I was once asked to exhibit some art at an established archival institution, the particular artwork they wanted to exhibit deals with a queer historical figure. 
              The institution wanted me to present this work during pride month, and I resisted saying that restricting queer artists to one month a year is extremely limiting. 
              I told them it is virtue signalling, and it contributes to a pattern in arge institutions that silo’s queer creatives, pushing them out to the fore for an institution to appear diverse for one month a year and not having to make any structural or institutional changes. 
              They responded well to my feedback, but ultimately did not change their offer.

              I felt that for my own integrity, I could not allow myself to potentially become part of the institutions virtue signalling, but also for the wider queer community, as if I took up the offer it might perpetuate the very things I was trying to work against. 
              So ultimately I pulled out of the show, even though it paid reasonably well and would have been a good opportunity.

              Looking back, I still feel I made the right decision. I gave them my thoughts, which they can do with what they will, and I feel like I kept my integrity in that scenario. 
              I was glad I stood up for my own values and beliefs in that moment, and I hope that it made even the slightest difference.

            <p><strong>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</strong>
                <br><br>
                Growing up I think my mum influenced me a lot, endlessly kind and supportive, she showed me how to care for others, but sometimes this was at the expense of her own wellbeing. 
                However this showed me that I should prioritise my own wellbeing, which ultimately allows me to help others more. 
                She is also quite spiritual, while also working in science, and I think this has influenced my outlook on the world and life. 
                She also has a love of creativity and music which really influenced me in my present life having studied art, loving music, sometimes DJing or playing in bands.

                I was also really influenced in my teen years in the hardcore/punk scene, learning about the punk ethos including becoming vegetarian at a young age. 
                I appreciate the open mindedness, freedom of expression and choice that punk ethos provided, and standing your ground in your beliefs. 
                Of course there are also negative aspects of the culture, but I learned from those as well. 
                Going into the art world I carry these values with me, although the art world can be equally fickle, I still maintain principles of freedom of expression and the punk ethos in a way has influenced my art.

            <p><strong>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</strong>
            <br><br>
            I think my openness and compassion are real strengths of mine, it allows me to work well with others, be attuned to their emotions and needs. 
            My past volunteer work managing a social group taught me a lot about how to have many different kinds of people in the same space, and navigating all the different energies. 
            I have carried this into my work career too. I love collaborating with others when making art, and I think this will help me in the collaborative learning to come.
            I am endlessly curious about the world, how things work, and how people think/feel. 
            I think this will help me in my learning journey, to stay curious about what it is that I'm doing, and be able to work through frustration by holding on to my own innate curiosity.
            Related to this is that I feel I am quite an optimist, not in a relentlessly idealistic way, but just carrying the feeling that things will just work themselves out eventually, which I find they do. 
            I think having this mindset will help me sit with difficult moments, knowing that it will take some time (and effort of course) but that things will work themselves out, it will all ‘click’.
            I also highly value humour. I think (in the right context and in the right way) it eases tensions between others and allows for trust and honesty to come in. 
            My humour will help me when working with others for those reasons.

            <p><strong>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</strong>
                <br><br>I know I can get stuck on problems too long, and feel uncomfortable to ask for help from others. 
                But I will have to learn to move through the discomfort, and I think I have slowly begun to do this in foundations.
                Impostor syndrome is also a big one for me, and this could prevent me from moving forward, being frozen by a sense of ‘not really belonging here’ etc.
                I sometimes struggle working in a group context, though I am a social person, I can get frustrated when i feel like group decisions don't align with my own decisions or thoughts/feelings about them. 
                I will need to be more open to moving with the group, and learn to compromise.

            <p><strong>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</strong>
            <br><br>At my job I was working with an artist who I would say was quite demanding, and would become quite upset when things didn’t go her way. 
            It became very difficult to communicate with her, because she was telling me how to do my job, without letting me offer my own perspective.
            I always maintained a patience with her when I saw that she was getting wound up, and I was very careful in the words I chose when I did want to assert myself. 
            I think my ability to keep calm and gently assert myself, helped the tension to dissipate or at least not keep rising to an explosion.            
            I put a lot of energy into making her ‘happy’ or not agitated, which was quite draining. 
            I do feel like I let her do and say things that were not acceptable, and in retrospect I would have actually just told her not to speak to me like that, let's take a breather and come back to this in 5 minutes when you have calmed down. 
            There were a couple of times I was assertive with her when I felt she was being unreasonable, and demanding things that were simply not possible. 
            Even though this resulted in more tension, and frustration directed towards me, I was happy that I stood my ground and not give in to unreasonable demands. 
            Perhaps I would have simply directed her to my manager in retrospect, instead of trying to deal with it myself as I was not in a position of power to actually do anything anyway.
