            <p><strong>When I was blocked on a simple problem:</strong><br><br>
                I was stuck in the fizzbuzz kata, trying to figure out how to use the remainder operator to set the conditions in my if/else statements. I had looked at my pseudocode and couldn’t see what i was doing wrong. I looked to google first, but I didn’t find the exact information I needed at that point, and couldn’t figure out what I was doing wrong. I decided to reach out for help after a while, and saw that someone was stuck in a similar place to me, but that I was simply missing a part of the code to equal the remainder to 0 for every condition. I learned that in the process of looking to others for help I can find the answers to the problem.

            <p><strong>When I elegantly solved a problem:</strong><br><br>
                I was trying to figure out how to use the find method in the array of objects to find ‘scooby’. I knew how to use find but couldn’t figure out to use it to find within an array of objects. I started with pseudocode but it didn’t quite give me enough to go off in terms of figuring it out. Then I tried a few different codes but none of them worked in the way I wanted, or were returning undefined. Then I googled the problem, and I stumbled across a thread that had multiple solutions, as I was looking I realised one of the solutions might do what i needed it to do, and return the first matching element from each object in the array. I tried it and it worked. I learned about looking to how others approach code to solve certain problems, I could find a solution that worked for me, and that there are often multiple solutions to one problem.

            <p><strong>Problem solving techniques:</strong><br><br>
                <strong>Pseudocode</strong><br><br>
                I feel averagely confident with pseudocode, although I feel like I'm not doing enough in my pseudo code and I’m not sure if I’m actually using it in the ‘right’ way. I think this will get better the more I use it, and just trying to break down the steps in a way I would understand.<br><br>
                <strong>Trying something</strong><br><br>
                I feel confident in just trying things, and that’s usually where I start out if I feel like I know what I need to do. It almost never works but I think it’s a good place to start, and console logging things out as I go helps me get my head around what I’m doing as I go.<br><br>
                <strong>Rubber ducky method</strong><br><br>
                I’m not super confident with the Rubber ducky method, I did try it a couple of times but it was hard to get past my own embarrassment at talking to an inanimate object. I think if I can push through this it will be really useful for me.<br><br>
                <strong>Reading error messages</strong><br><br>
                I feel a solid medium on reading error messages, I think there’s more to learn but it is helpful in terms of seeing what you are returning, and where in your code things are broken.<br><br>
                <strong>Console.logging</strong><br><br>
                I feel pretty confident with console logging, I used it a lot when I was working through problems to see what an element contained and especially to see what a function might be returning.<br><br>
                <strong>Googling</strong><br><br>
                I’m confident with googling, and I’m getting to know what the most useful sites are when they come up in search results. I think as I get to know the jargon of javascript more I will feel more confident in knowing exactly what to look for.<br><br>
                <strong>Asking my peers for help</strong><br><br>
                I feel confident in asking peers for help, I’ve been sticking to my homegroup and a couple of people I know but I think as I get used to it I will feel confident reaching out to the tech-questions channel on discord.<br><br>
                <strong>Asking coaches for help</strong><br><br>
                I feel less confident in asking coaches for help, but I am treating it as the step above asking peers for help so haven’t done it as much. But I know they are the people with the knowledge who can help me the most, in future I think I will reach out for help more to facilitators.<br><br>
                <strong>Improving my process with reflection</strong><br><br>
                I’m getting a lot out of reflection, and seeing for myself what my process is and how I deal with frustration and getting stuck. Being able to reflect on what works for me or not is shaping how I am moving forward with problem solving, which I think can only be a good thing.<br><br>
